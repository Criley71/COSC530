true dependencies:
  gap larger than 1 cycle between issue and execute start
  if a load comes after a store then any gap between executed end and memory read NOT including the cycle the store is committing
  if multiple stores have the same address and then a load with the same address is waiting for both to commit it is still only 1 true dependence per cycle1
  if multiple loads are waiting on 1 store with the same address then count it as 2 true dependencies (again not when a store is committing)

data memory dependencies:
  if a load has to wait to do memory read for another load
  if a load has to wait to do memory read because of a store commit the same cycle
  even if a load is waiting on a previous store with the same address if either of the 2 above are true it is just a data mem dependence
  
hieracrchy:
  check if store is committing - +1 data dependence for every load ready for memory read stage
  check if earlier load - +1 data dependence for all loads ready for memory read stage
  check if load has same address as a store - +1 true dependence for each load with the same address after
